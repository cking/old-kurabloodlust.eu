After a long, very long time, the website is back.
I switched the used theme from mainroad to dream-plus (with a few of my tweaks).
As always, you can see my changes on https://github.com/cking/kurabloodlust.eu

I still have to fix a few things here and there (display all static pages, as well as a portfolio)

As a sidenote: I stopped hosting Twitchcord a while ago and have dropped the offer (as it was not used).

I am available for hiring or projects, just contact me via one of the methods you can see in the about me section.
It is a bit hidden, but available once you click on the icon in the upper left.
