As of right now, I am sponsoring hosting for [Twitchcord](https://www.twitchcord.com).

I am offering cheap hosting for projects I like. If you are interested, contact me via one of the methods you can see in the right sidebar (Mastodon and E-Mail preferred).

I am offering a Caddy backed server with https certificate, redis, postgresql, node v8.5, python 3.6, golang 1.9 and php 7. Also, you will get mail hosting, and if you need a domain, you can get a subdomain under `paars.xyz`. I am sure, we can decide on a plan fitting for you.
