<h1>So, Who Am I?</h1>

<br>
I’m just another teenager who likes **writing**, **programming** and **making stuff**. Even setting the title as **Who Am I**  for this article is reminding me of `whoami` in Linux. I feel the inner urge to contribute something to the Internet because I love writing and I believe posting something online enables users all around the globe to see your work and suggest improvements.

That’s all that I can think of right now. Hopefully I’ll add something more to this later on. :sweat_smile:
